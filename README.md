## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am a research engineer at [Inria](https://www.inria.fr). I work on [Why3](https://why3.lri.fr), a tool to prove programs correct. I also contribute to [SPARK](https://github.com/AdaCore/spark), a prover for Ada programs that uses Why3.

I am interested in logic, theorem proving and proof assistants.
