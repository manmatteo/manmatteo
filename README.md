## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am a research engineer at [IRIF](https://www.irif.fr), the research center in theoretical computer science at the Paris-CitÃ© University.

Previously I have been at [Inria](https://www.inria.fr), working on the [Why3](https://why3.org) and [SPARK](https://github.com/AdaCore/spark) tools for deductive software verification.

I am interested in logic, theorem proving and proof assistants.
